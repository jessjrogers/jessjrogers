### Hi, I'm Jessica! I am a Tech Writer, escape room enthusiast, and bar trvia champion. 

ðŸ’¬ I took a detour from the world of tech writing to do some time in the marketing trenches, but I have found my way back from the dark side.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... adding to my portoflio 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... SQL, Linux, and API documentation 

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns ... she/her

âš¡ Fun fact: ... I am a big reader, and I am always ready to offer a book recommendation. (I am always looking for good recommendations as well!) I am on a bit of a non-fiction kick as of late. Some of my current favorites are "Cultish:The Language of Fanaticism" by Amanda Montell, and "The Truth About Lies" by Aja Raden. I recently started reading "Dopesick" by Beth Macy, so that may be my next big recommendation. Stay tuned!
